Here is a list of programming patterns considered "Object-Oriented" in traditional paradigms but can be effectively implemented in Erlang using functional principles and concurrent processes. The inherent characteristics of Erlang, such as immutability, message passing, and processes, make many OO patterns applicable in slightly altered forms.

# Patterns Adaptable to Erlang
## Creational Patterns
**Factory**
Functions create new processes or data structures dynamically based on parameters.

**Abstract Factory**
Functions that return other factory functions based on configuration or context.

**Builder**
Functions assemble complex data structures step-by-step.

**Prototype**
Clone data structures by transforming or extending immutable values.

## Structural Patterns
**Adapter**
Functions wrap or transform APIs to align with expected signatures.

**Bridge**
Separate interface from implementation by using function references or modules.

**Decorator**
Add behavior to functions by composing them or wrapping them with higher-order functions.

**Fa√ßade**
Provide a simple interface to a group of related functions.

**Flyweight**
Share and reuse data efficiently, e.g., using Erlang's efficient immutable data structures like lists or maps.

**Proxy**
Control access to another process or function, often using a middleman process.

## Behavioral Patterns
**Chain of Responsibility**
Pass data through a chain of processes or functions until one handles it.

**Command**
Encapsulate requests or operations as data and send them to processes.

**Interpreter**
Build interpreters for domain-specific languages using tokens and processes.

**Iterator**
Provide sequential access to elements in a collection using recursive functions or stateful processes.

**Mediator**
A process manages communication between other processes.

**Memento**
Store and restore state snapshots using data structures.

**Observer**
Notify multiple processes when an event or state change occurs.

**State**
Change process behavior dynamically based on internal state.

**Strategy**
Dynamically choose an algorithm by passing different functions as parameters.

**Template Method**
Define a skeleton algorithm with hooks for extending or overriding steps using functions.

**Visitor**
Decouple data and operations by defining functions that act on data structures.

## Concurrency Patterns
**Actor**
Encapsulate state and behavior in processes, communicating via message passing.

**Publish-Subscribe**
Processes register interest in events and are notified when events occur.

**Event Sourcing**
Record all state changes as events, replayable to rebuild state.

**Scheduler**
Coordinate work across multiple processes, such as worker pools.

**Supervision**
Monitor and restart failing processes.

## Architectural Patterns
**Model-View-Controller (MVC)**
Separate concerns into processes for data (model), presentation (view), and control logic (controller).

**Pipe-and-Filter**
Chain processes or functions that transform data step-by-step.

**Ports and Adapters**
Isolate core logic from external systems with ports (interfaces) and adapters (implementations).

**Client-Server**
Divide systems into clients requesting services and servers providing services.

Notes on Functional vs OO Patterns in Erlang
Immutable Data: Data transformations replace mutable state. For example, the State pattern alters a process's internal behavior using immutable state data.
Processes as Objects: Erlang processes encapsulate state and behavior, often substituting objects in OO designs.
Message Passing: Patterns like Mediator, Observer, and Chain of Responsibility are natural fits due to Erlang's asynchronous messaging.
